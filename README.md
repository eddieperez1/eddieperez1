	- Analyze Kickstarter Plays' outcomes and goals to see the effects of launch data and success rate. 
	- Filter and visualize the data using excel
- stock-analysis
	- VBA script to calculate the Total Volume and Return of each stock
	- Refactored script is examined with advantages and disadvantages of each
- Election_Analysis
	- Analyzed voting results for candidates, counties, and which candidate won using Python
- School_District_Analysis
	- Analze school testing proficiency for trends in school spending, school type, and school size against student reading and math scores.
	- Summarize the school testing proficiency data into a summary dataframe showing totals and % passing reading and math scores using python and pandas
	- Analyze the same data by omitting ninth graders for a specific school for academic dishonesty
- PyBer_Analysis
	- Analyze ride sharing application data to show summary for each city type(urban, suburban, rural) using Pandas
	- Visualize trends for weekly fares, ride sharing usage, and payment using matplotlib pyplot and Pandas
- World_Weather_Analysis
	- Adding the weather description to the weather data. Then, use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels using google maps api and openweather api.
- Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
	- Database creation and query execution with ERD using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
- Movies-ETL
	- Extract, transform and load data from three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data into a PostgreSQL database
	- Confirm ETL process by querying the data stored in the database
- surfs_up
	- Investigate temperature trends for opening a surf shop
	- Query the weather data from a sqlite database using sql alchemy
	- Analyze the mean and variance of temperatures to analyze temperature trends using Pandas  
- Mission-to-Mars
	- Web scraping information, news and images of Mars from several websites and show it on a web page.
	- Splinter will be used to web scrape the websites then the data will be stored in a mongo database. 
	- Displayed data on a web page using flask.
- UFOs
	- Create a website about UFOs and their sightings from a UFO sightings dataset
- Belly-Button-Plotly
	- Design and create a dashboard that will show bateria culture samples found in the belly button 
- Mapping_Earthquakes
	- Create a map using MapBox to display Earthquake and Tectonic Plate data
	- Visual Earthquake and Tectonic Plate data onto a website using d3 and plotly libraries 
- bikesharing
	- Visualize NYC CitiBike Data to see if bike share can be implemented in Des Moise using Tableau
- AutosRUsWithRStudio
	- Analyzes the MechaCar dataset with Linear Regression
	- Predict MPG, summary of suspension coils, t-test of suspension coil by manufacturing lota proposed statistical study of city fuel efficiency of MechaCar versus the competition.
	- Perform statistical tests in R using RStudio. 
- Amazon_Vine_Analysis
	- Performe ETL on the Amazon Vine data using pyspark and Amazon Web Services(AWS) to load the data into Postgres pgAdmin and then analyze the vine table to compare Vine vs non-Vine reviews
- Credit_Risk_Analysis
	- Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling and ensemble
	- Use Logistic Regression across multiple different sampling techniques.
	- Compare results to see which method has the highest accuracy score and highest sensitivity
- Cryptocurrencies_ml
	- unsupervised machine learning clustering to a dataset about crypto currencies.
	- The data was cleaned and transformed to numeric values so the data can be fitted to the model. 
	- Principle Component Analysis is used to reduce features then the data is scaled. 
	- Then K-Means algorithm was used to predict crypto currencies by clustering. 
	- The results were then displayed with hvplot and plotly.
- NBA-Prediction
	- Investigates if you can predict the outcomes of NBA basketball games. 
	- Team and Player data were the main features used in a grid search. 
	- The best model found was Ordinary Least Square(OLS) Linear Regression for wins by a team and total score by a player and Logistic Regression Classifier for if a team goes to playoffs. 
	- A website was created to make predictions and show visualizations of data.
